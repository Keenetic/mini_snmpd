This program is just a quick and dirty hack to get mini_snmpd accessible over
an SSH tunnel for users that run their SSH server on Windows. It is by no means
a replacement for more mature and robust software tools. If you are running a
Unix-like operating system, socat (http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/) should
be a better solution.
